        TLS1.2 supports a number of ciphers, like RC4 and DES, that are now considered 
        too weak to be used safely. Node.js already disables most of them in its default 
        configuration, but they still exist and can be used if you are using TLS 1.2. 

        TLS1.3 supports only AES256, AES128, and CHACHA20 as ciphers; they are currently 
        considered strong.
