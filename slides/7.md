        New default Middleware

        > Middleware are functions that can manage an incoming request
          and pass it to a handler by calling `next()`

        ## .json

        You no longer have to import `body-parser`, you can use express.json() and
        it will provide the json in req.body

        ## .text

        The .text middleware will convert the body to text in the req.body

        ## .raw

        The .raw will prove the buffer object in the req.body
