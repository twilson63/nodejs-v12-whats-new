          TLS used to support two ways to agree on a shared key in order 
          to protect the data exchanged during a session: RSA, and (EC)DH. 
          
          RSA key agreement has a history of bugs and, did not support 
          forward secrecy. 

          Support for RSA has been removed from the key agreement step which 
          is now always done with ECDH (OpenSSL doesnâ€™t support DH). 

          This simplifies the handshake, the protocol, and the cipher suites. 
          Note that RSA can still be used to help validate the identify of 
          the two parties sharing data through the session.
