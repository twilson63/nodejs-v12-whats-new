        NodeJS is single threaded which means it can only execute one synchronous 
        command at a time. 

        Node uses and event loop to create asynchronous I/O, which allows node 
        to call multiple I/O events in parallel and still handle other requests.

        In v12, Node has launched `worker_threads`, this api allows you to run
        background threads in your node application to perform CPU intensive 
        tasks, like parsing, image processing, etc.
