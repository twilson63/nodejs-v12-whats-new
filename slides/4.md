        After a long road of several iterations, we now have ES modules support that is
        shipping in v12. Currently under an experimental flag. The flag will be removed 
        in October when v12 moves to LTS Mode.

        ## What do you need to know?

        * name files *.mjs = you can use es6 modules syntax
        * set `type` to `module` in your package.json and *.js is es6

        > For now you have to run node with `--experimental-modules`
