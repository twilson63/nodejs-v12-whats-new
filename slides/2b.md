      Forward secrecy means that if an attacker manages to obtain the 
      private key used to set up an earlier session, 
      they still will not be able to recover the content of that session. 
      TLS 1.2 could not provide forward secrecy when using RSA key exchange, 
      and you had to opt-in for the feature when using (EC)DH key agreement. 
      With TLS1.3, all cipher suites provide forward secrecy because they 
      use ephemeral (EC)DH key agreement.
