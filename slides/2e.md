          Symmetric ciphers need to be used in “modes” that allow them 
          to encrypt streams of data, not just single blocks. 

          TLS1.2 uses cipher modes that were thought secure at the time 
          of its design, but that now have a history of being sucessfully 
          attacked. 

          TLS1.3 supports only AEAD (authenticated encryption with 
          additional data), cipher modes.
